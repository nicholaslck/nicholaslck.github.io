title: ATV iOS
description: This app was created as part of ATV's comeback as an online broadcasting company. It serves as a platform for users to access VOD contents and live streams. Developed using Objective-C and following the MVC architecture, the app features a visually captivating landing view with a circular wheel-like menu. Implementing the intricate geometry required for the menu was a challenging task. The first app I have ever made. Currently the latest version of the app has been revamped after I left.
