title: Predictive Reversible Halftoning
description: The objective of this research project was to convert color images into halftone images while ensuring reversibility. This means that the resulting black and white halftone image could be transformed back into the original color image using a deep learning model. The project was implemented using PyTorch, and extensive experiments were conducted to validate the approach. The findings and methodology of this project were published in the TVCG journal in 2023.
