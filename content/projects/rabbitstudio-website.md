title: RabbitStudio Website
description: This is a one-month freelance contract where I built the company public website for RabbitStudio. Starting from scratch, I developed the site using Nuxt.js. The website included impressive Lottie animations and CSS transitions. It was a server-side rendered (SSR) application hosted on a single docker container.
