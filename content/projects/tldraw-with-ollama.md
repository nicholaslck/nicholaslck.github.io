title: Tldraw with ollama
description: This project offers users the opportunity to draw wireframes and generate HTML templates by utilizing LLaVA models. It is an adaptation of the tldraw-make-real project. Rather than relying on the external OpenAI GPT-4 API, this project integrates with ollama, enabling offline inference. This empowers developers to design and test without the need for corporate AI dependencies.
