	<p>Welcome, visitor!</p>
	<p>
		Well... as you can see, there are nothing here. Previously I have my own personal site, but I
		decided not to continue that domain and wanted to move to github.io. At the same time, I think,
		why not do a revamp of the site and make it more a comfortable space for me to publish contents?
		So here it is, my new site, in progress. I will try to post some of my thoughts here, and maybe
		some of my projects. I hope you enjoy your stay here. Stay tuned.
