title: i-CABLE News iOS
description: The project involved the development of an iOS app that serves as a news display platform and enables users to upload instant videos for reporting urgent news. The app was developed following the MVVM architecture, ensuring a structured design. To handle the signal processing, we utilized RxSwift, which allowed for a testable code base and efficient implementation. Currently the latest version of the app has been revamped after I left.
